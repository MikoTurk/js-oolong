Overstrike.js
=============
[![NPM version][npm-badge]](http://badge.fury.io/js/overstrike)
[npm-badge]: https://badge.fury.io/js/overstrike.png

**Overstrike.js** is utility library in the style of Underscore.js with
**consistent inherited property** handling and the **simplest implementation**
and more usefulness curated by yours truly.

If you know Underscore.js (or Lodash.js), then you might know it has
inconsistent handling of inherited properties, often outright ignoring them.
This leads to unnecessary complexity, arbitrary constraints and
a leaky-implementation in your code or public APIs. Among other things, this
library is a fix to those problems by always honoring inherited properties in
given objects.

Overstrike.js is work-in-progress and gets expanded on a need-to basis at the
moment. It'll get most of the utility methods of Underscore at one point and API
documentation.
